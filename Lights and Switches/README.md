## Colaborations:
 
 In this lab I did not specifically collaborate with anyone but I did receive some help from the Discord on certain implementation logic and also on how to make the correct variables and structure my program. I don't really know their names but it was a lot of people.


 ## Lab Summary

 The main idea of this lab was to introduce us to the idea of working with the actual hardware. Learning about interrupts, LED displays, hardware, and bit manipulation. The lab document did a good job of expressing all the important aspects of the lab. How to use all the tools available that we had in order to complete it. I don't think there was something completely out of the scope of the lab doc.


 ## Lab Approach

 My approach for this lab was to start as early as possible in order to get a headstart on something that was completely new to me. I had never seen any of these types of topics before in C and I wanted to be able to get ahead and not rush in the end. I made sure to read the doc thoroughly to get an idea of what the lab was asking for first then I got to coding. Starting early and reading the doc really helped me get started and once things clicked and I got an idea of what I was doing I was able to work much faster. Since nothing went wrong after things clicked for me,I don't think I would do anything differently if I were to do the lab again. I say that after everything clicked for me I did not struggle as much but a big part of that was all the students on the Discord who helped me with the logic and helped me understand what to do. 


 ## Lab Results

 The results for this lab are just that, results. I got to complete the lab after working hard at it for some time. I spent around 12 hours working on this lab and I said before most of it was spent getting to understand what to actually do and get started. I really liked seeing the results of my code on a physical piece of hardware rather than just an output on my terminal or on MPLAB. I think that this lab was the most worthwhile because I like to see the fruits of my labor and this lab definitely did that unlike the others. I have been suggesting this for all the past labs but I think that some video sources on some of the topics covered in the lab doc would be great in order to get some more information that isn't just readings. The hardest part of this lab was just getting started as I said but I think that is something normal for anything new. The grading is appropriate as did the lab doc for this lab and the sections that I attended.

## Extra Credit

 In the lab doc the extra credit described was completely different from the one shown in the demo. I just followed what the lab doc said and made the buttons responsible for freezing the LED in movement. Everything else works like the demo except mine doesn't light anything on and only one switch is responsible for the button up or down, just like the lab doc said. For button bounce as well the lab doc only mentions one switch being responsible for all the buttons down or up, while the demo has a switch responsible for a corresponding button. For bounce buttons I just followed the demo as it was what made the most sense to me and also a grader/tutor on Discord said that it was best to follow the demos. I hope I can get full credit as I followed the demo provided for bounce buttons and the doc for the extra credit.
