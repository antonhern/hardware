# I did this lab Solo
    For this lab I implemented:

    Agent.c
    AgentTest.c
    Message.c
    MessageTest.c

    I did not do any extra credit attempts.

    I did not collaborate with anyone in specific besides asking for help with some logic and implementation to my classmates on the course discord chat.

# Introduction:
   From what I understand this lab works by sending messages of all types that are encoded and decoded back and forth between two kits or in my case the python script and my kit. The messages are generated,encoded, and decoded by the module Message.c and are received and processed by the state machine in Agent.c. Agent.c decides what to do with each message, whether it is your turn or your opponent's turn, as well as if you got hit, or you hit your opponent. These messages are sent back and forth and processed by Agent.c until someone wins the game.
 
   What worked well for this lab was being able to implement each piece at a time and testing it individually with an already working system in the object files, which made it less difficult to find the bugs in each piece of the program. That is probably the testing strategy that I used the most as well as using the python scripts as much as I could.
 
   I learned how to encode and decode messages in a certain format using C in this lab, as well as hot to make much more in depth programs for the physical kits. I also learned that it is ok to not get everything perfect, my lab has some flaws that I couldn't really fix but I think it's fine. The thing that I liked most about this lab was playing the game and getting to see the boats getting crossed out on the display.
